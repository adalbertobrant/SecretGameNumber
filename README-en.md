Welcome to the "Secret Game" repository! This is an open-source project created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and we're very happy to have you here to contribute during Hacktoberfest.

## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is an annual month-long celebration of open-source software. The goal is to encourage contribution to the free software community, especially for beginners. By making a minimum number of contributions (usually 4 pull requests) to participating public repositories, you can earn an exclusive reward.

## üìú Contribution Rules

To ensure a positive and organized experience for everyone, please follow these rules:

1.  **Respect the Code of Conduct:**

    - First and foremost, read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/adalbertobrant/SecretGameNumber/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all contributors to promote a friendly and respectful environment.

2.  **Choose an Issue:**

    - Browse through the project's [Issues tab](https://github.com/adalbertobrant/secretgamenumber/issues).
    - Choose an issue that interests you and comment on it asking to be assigned (`"I would like to work on this issue"`).
    - Wait for a project maintainer to assign the issue to you before starting work. This prevents two people from working on the same thing.

3.  **Fork the Repository:**

    - Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this page to create a copy of the project in your own GitHub account.

4.  **Create a Branch for your Contribution:**

    - In your fork, create a new branch to work on your issue. Use a descriptive name.
    - **Exception - Deploy Tutorials:** For deploy tutorial issues, the rule is to create the branch with your GitHub username. Ex: `branch: "your-username-tutorial-issuenumber"`.
    - Command to create the branch: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`

5.  **Make your Changes:**

    - Implement the functionality or fix the bug.
    - Make clear and concise commits.

6.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**

    - Push your changes to your fork: `git push origin your-branch-name`.
    - Return to the original repository page and you'll see a button for "Compare & pull request".
    - Create a PR with a clear title and description explaining what you did. If possible, link the issue you resolved using the syntax `Closes #123`.

7.  **Wait for Review:**
    - A maintainer will review your PR. They might ask for some changes.
    - After approval, your PR will be merged into the main project. Congratulations on your contribution!
    - **Add your name:** As part of your contribution, don't forget to add your name to the contributors list in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file!
    - Remember to star the repository and share it.
    - Remember: there are only 10k swags, so make your PRs quickly.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Project Locally

1.  Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/adalbertobrant/secretgamenumber.git`
2.  Navigate to the project folder: `cd secretgamenumber`
